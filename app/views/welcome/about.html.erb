    <div class="about_text">
      Hello! Thank you for visiting my portfolio.<br /><br />
      My name is Stephen Wentling and I am a Ruby on Rails, Django and React developer looking for opportunities worldwide and currently employed with Procore Technologies and as a consultant for Phantom Design and Origin Analytics. You'll find that I'm passionate about software development and always looking for ways to improve and learn. I'm motivated to succeed, a quick study, and always working towards a goal.<br /><br />
      On a personal note, I'm married and have a dog that my wife and I both spoil quite a bit. For leisure we typically will go out with the dog to the beach or for a hike. But otherwise I'm a bit of a gamer and an avid fan of English Premier League soccer.<br /><br />
      That's just a little bit about me, thank you again for stopping by and feel free to reach out to me anytime!
