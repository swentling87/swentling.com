<h3 class="projectBodyHeader">Explanation</h3>
<div class="projectBody">
Blocmarks is a social bookmarking application that allows users to email, manage and share bookmarked URLs and was created with the help of a loose framework from the Bloc curriculum. This was my second project I developed also for educational purposes, and required more independent design and implementation.
