<p>Welcome to my newly re-designed portfolio. I decided that my previous Jekyll portfolio hosted by GitHub was just not what I was looking for and to make a change. Here you will find my various academic projects, personal projects and some of the professional work that I'm allowed to share. I'm currently holding two jobs with one as a devloper for <b>Phantom Design</b> based out of Los Angeles and my full-time at State Farm as an insurance adjuster. Check back from time to time for updates, things I find interesting and more posts like this.</p>
