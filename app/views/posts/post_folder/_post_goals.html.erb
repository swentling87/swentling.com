<p>So... I've accomplished this fancy new portfolio with plenty of projects but no content! It's awfully hard to think of what to write here it turns out. Therefore I'm beginning to keep a list of topics/ideas which I can write about and updating it as I come across these ideas rather than sit here and try to think of something to write about. It's my goal to post something new and technical each week. I'll keep them short and sweet but informative. By writing it here, I'm putting the goal out there so I keep myself more accountable to it.</p>
