<p>Well even though this may all look very much the same as it has since it's essentially been up online there have been a number of changes lately. You can feel free to check out some of the various changes over at the GitHub repository for this <%= link_to "Here", "https://github.com/swentling87/swentling.com" %>. Careful analysis will show that I've rethought the way that I handle images and their association to projects as well as some improvements on linking throughout the site for better navigation. But the big deal is that you'll find that I've added some shots from professional projects. No code unfortunately but that's the way it goes... Browse through the projects pages and check them out!</p>
